## API

FilmFave uses the [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to fetch movie and TV show data.

### Key Features

1. **API Integration:** I used the TMDb API to access a wide range of movie and TV show data, including now playing movies, upcoming movies, on-the-air TV shows, movie details, genres, and videos.

2. **Navigation:** To create a smooth and intuitive user experience, I implemented React Navigation to handle navigation between different screens, allowing users to easily switch between the home screen, movie details screen, and TV show details screen.

3. **State Management:** React's useState hook was used to manage component-level state, allowing me to update and track various states throughout the app. For example, I used state to manage whether a movie or TV show was liked and the number of likes it received.

4. **UI Components:** Custom UI components were designed to create an appealing and user-friendly interface. I utilized ImageBackground, TouchableOpacity, FlatList, and other React Native components to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

5. **Trailer Integration:** To enhance the user experience, I integrated video trailers of movies using the YouTube API. Users can watch trailers directly within the app, making it easier for them to decide which movies to watch.

6. **User Interaction:** I enabled users to share their favorite movies and TV shows with friends by implementing the Share API. Additionally, users can give ratings to movies and TV shows, providing valuable feedback and engaging them further with the content.
